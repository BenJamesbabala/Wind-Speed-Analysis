# Modeling the Joint Probability Distribution of Wind Speed and Direction using Gaussian Mixture Models

## What is this?

This is a Python program for modelling the joint distribution of wind speed and direction.

The method is based on:

1. Harris, Cook, The parent wind speed distribution: Why Weibull?, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610514001056

2. Gaussian Mixture Modles, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html

, along with other analysis.

## Getting Started, for first-time Python Users

### 1. Install Anaconda

Download at
https://www.continuum.io/downloads

This repo use Python 2.7, so you should use the 2.7 version

### 2. Additional Environment Configuration

After installing Anaconda, there are still some additional packages need to install:

1. Seaborn
https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/
2. Windrose
https://github.com/scls19fr/windrose
3. jsmin
https://github.com/tikitu/jsmin

Just run

    pip install seaborn
    pip install windrose
    pip install jsmin

in your command line to install them

### 3. Download the current repo

### 4. Start Jupyter Notebook, and open the `GMM.ipynb`

## For experienced Scipy Users

Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then run

Linux, OS X: `source activate windspeed`

Windows: `activate windspeed`

The code is in `GMM.ipynb`, you can start to play with it now.
